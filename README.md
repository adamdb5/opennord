# opennord
A Go library for interacting with the Linux nordvpn daemon.

![Build Workflow](https://github.com/adamdb5/opennord/actions/workflows/go-build.yml/badge.svg)

Opennord does NOT interact with the commandline utility, instead it communicates with the nordvpn daemon via gRPC.

Documentation coming soon.

Reverse engineering write-up coming soon.
